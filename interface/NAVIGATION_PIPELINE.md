# Navigation Pipeline — Technical Reference

Companion to **README.md**. This file is the engineering spec: every data
boundary, every JSON field, every ROS topic, plus academic citations for
each algorithm in the stack. Read this when the README is too vague.

> **Two stacks, one algorithm.** The same `compute_plan()` is used in two
> integrations:
>
> | | **Mac dev sandbox** | **Deployed system** (per Tankhun's spec) |
> |---|---|---|
> | Goal in | `POST /plan` (JSON) or `/goal_pose` via rosbridge | `/goal_pose` (`PoseStamped`) on Zenoh |
> | Path out | `path_plan.json` on disk + `/navigation/waypoints` over rosbridge | `/formation/path` (`PoseArray`, latched / `transient_local`) |
> | Footprint | scalar `formation_radius` arg | `/formation/footprint` (`Polygon`); planner converts to bounding-circle radius |
> | Robot poses | single `start` arg | both `/tb3_0/pose` + `/tb3_1/pose` → midpoint = virtual center |
> | Map source | `map.json` on disk (preprocessed) | `map.json` loaded once at node startup (long-term: read `lab.db` directly) |
>
> Section 3 describes the dev-sandbox wire format. Section 6 (added) is the
> deployed-system equivalent. The algorithm itself (sections 4-5) is shared.

## 3. Data schemas at each boundary

### 3.1 `map.json` (Mac, written by `db_to_map_json.py` ± `inpaint_floor.py` ± `tighten_obstacles.py`)

| Field | Python type | Shape / units | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metadata.resolution` | float | meters per cell | grid cell size (default 2 cm) |
| `metadata.floor_z` | float | meters (Z-up) | RANSAC floor height |
| `metadata.robot_height` | float | meters | passes through to envelope filter |
| `metadata.robot_clearance` | float | meters | added on top of `robot_height` |
| `metadata.min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` | float | meters, world frame | bbox of the cloud |
| `metadata.grid_width, grid_height` | int | cells | shape of `grid` |
| `metadata.point_count` | int | count | length of `points` |
| `metadata.axis_convention` | str | `"z-up"` | REP-103 frame tag |
| `grid` | `list[list[int]]` | `H × W`, values `{0,1,2}` | 0 = unknown, 1 = ground, 2 = obstacle |
| `points` | `list[[float, float, float]]` | `N × 3`, meters | downsampled cloud (for the 3D viewer) |
| `colors` | `list[[int, int, int]]` | `N × 3`, 0–255 | per-point RGB |

`inpaint_floor.py` only mutates `grid` (unknown → ground via closing + flood-fill). `tighten_obstacles.py` only mutates `grid` (ground → obstacle when above-floor evidence exceeds a threshold). Neither rewrites `metadata` or `points`.

### 3.2 `path_plan.json` (Mac, written by `server.py:/plan`)

| Field | Python type | Shape / units | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metadata.formation_radius` | float | meters | radius **actually used** (post-cascade) |
| `metadata.formation_radius_requested` | float | meters | what the caller asked for |
| `metadata.radius_reduced` | bool | — | `true` if cascade had to shrink |
| `metadata.cascade_attempts` | `list[[float, str]]` | (radius_m, status) | e.g. `[[0.45,"no path"], [0.36,"ok"]]` |
| `metadata.vc_distance` | float | meters | total polyline length of the VC path |
| `metadata.travel_time_sec` | float | seconds | `vc_distance / 0.18` (MAX_LINEAR estimate) |
| `metadata.inflation_iters` | int | cells | `ceil(used_radius / resolution)` |
| `metadata.inflation_cells` | int | cell count | obstacle-halo cells (for viewer) |
| `metadata.start_snap_dist` | float | meters | how far the start was relocated |
| `metadata.goal_snap_dist` | float | meters | same for the goal |
| `metadata.target_spacing` | float | meters | arc-length resampling spacing (0 = off) |
| `metadata.yaw_policy` | str | `"tangent"` / `"free"` / `"smooth_to_goal"` | controller behavior selector |
| `metadata.start_yaw` | float | radians | requested start yaw |
| `metadata.goal_yaw` | float | radians | requested goal yaw |
| `metadata.navigable_bounds` | dict or null | min/max x/y, cells, area_m² | reachable region (main connected component) |
| `metadata.map_bounds` | dict | min/max x/y in meters | grid extent in world frame |
| `virtual_center.start` | `[float, float]` | meters | snapped VC start |
| `virtual_center.goal` | `[float, float]` | meters | snapped VC goal |
| `virtual_center.path_raw` | `list[[float, float]]` | meters | unsimplified A\* output |
| `virtual_center.waypoints` | `list[[float, float]]` | meters | simplified + APF-shifted + arc-resampled |
| `virtual_center.headings` | `list[float]` | radians | path-tangent yaw at each waypoint |
| `robots[i]` | dict | per robot | `{name, offset_local:[dx,dy], color, track:list[[x,y]], start, goal}` |
| `inflation_cells` | `list[[int, int]]` | (col, row) pairs | halo cells (for viewer overlay) |
| `seq` | int | monotonic counter | bumped per replan |
| `wall_clock_iso` | str | ISO-8601 UTC | timestamp |
| `start_source` | str | `"explicit (user click)"` or live-pose | added by `/plan` only |

### 3.3 What the **Pi actually receives** (the headline answer)

The browser publishes via rosbridge ([index.html:1320](index.html)):

- **Topic**: `/navigation/waypoints`
- **Message type**: `geometry_msgs/msg/PoseArray`

PoseArray wire format:

| Field | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `header.frame_id` | string | `"map"` |
| `header.stamp` | `builtin_interfaces/Time` | `{secs:0, nsecs:0}` (browser does NOT stamp time — see §4 risks) |
| `poses[i].position.x` | float64 | meters, world X (= `wp[0]`) |
| `poses[i].position.y` | float64 | meters, world Y (= `wp[1]`) |
| `poses[i].position.z` | float64 | hardcoded `0.0` |
| `poses[i].orientation.{x, y}` | float64 | `0` (yaw-only quaternion) |
| `poses[i].orientation.z` | float64 | `sin(yaw / 2)` |
| `poses[i].orientation.w` | float64 | `cos(yaw / 2)` |

For all interior poses, `yaw = headings[i]` (path tangent). For the **final pose**, `yaw = goal.yawRad` if the user moved the orientation slider, otherwise the last heading. This is how `goal_yaw` survives the rosbridge crossing.

**The Pi receives ONLY the PoseArray.** The entire `metadata` block (cascade_attempts, vc_distance, navigable_bounds, etc.) lives in `path_plan.json` for the GUI's benefit and is NOT transmitted. `_waypoints_cb` ([navigation_node.py:243](../swerve_transport_project/ros2_ws/src/swerve_formation/swerve_formation/navigation_node.py)) decodes each Pose into `np.array([x, y, yaw])` — that's all the Pi sees: a list of `(x, y, yaw)` triples in the `map` frame.

### 3.4 Why `geometry_msgs/PoseArray`?

It's the **ROS-standard "ordered list of 6-DoF poses."** Nav2's planners (`PathToPoses`, `ComputePathThroughPoses`) and most ROS 2 visualisation tools (RViz `PoseArray` display, `nav2_smoother`) consume exactly this type. By emitting it directly, the Pi-side `navigation_node` is interchangeable with any Nav2-compatible planner — the laptop just slots in where Nav2 would. A custom dict would have meant a custom `.msg` definition, package rebuild on the Pi, and rosbridge-side type registration. PoseArray is the lowest-friction choice.

---

## 4. Open questions / risks

1. **Metadata is stripped at the rosbridge boundary.** If `goal_yaw` ever needs to differ from the final-segment tangent (it currently does — see [index.html:1329-1335](index.html)), it is encoded only in `poses[-1].orientation`. Anyone reusing this pipeline must remember the `metadata` block is Mac-only.
2. **Header stamp is hardcoded `{0, 0}`** ([index.html:1345](index.html)). Anything downstream that filters by message age (tf2 lookups, message_filters) will see "ancient" messages. The Pi node ignores the stamp, but RViz playback and rosbag introspection look wrong.
3. **`frame_id` is hardcoded `"map"`.** If the EKF publishes odom under a different parent frame, waypoints will be misinterpreted. There is no TF check on the Pi side.
4. **The 0.18 m/s travel-time estimate is a UI hint only.** Firmware cap is 0.198 m/s — off by ~10%.
5. **Path is published one-shot, no ack.** In the dev sandbox a dropped websocket frame loses the entire plan; the Pi has no `/navigation/waypoints/status` topic to surface failure. The recovery is to re-run **Plan Path**, which re-writes `path_plan.json` and re-publishes the waypoints. (Note: **Send Goal** publishes the goal pose alone — it is not a path re-publish.) The deployed system avoids this class of failure entirely by using `transient_local` QoS on `/formation/path`: late subscribers and reconnections receive the latched plan automatically.

## 5. Algorithms & Citations

This stack is built almost entirely from classical, peer-reviewed algorithms — the contribution of the work is the integration and tuning, not new theory. Below is the canonical reference for each component.

6. **Singleton-noise pre-filter (neighbour-count test)** — drop obstacle pixels whose 3×3 neighbourhood contains no other obstacle pixel. Replaces an earlier `binary_opening` step that silently eroded 1-cell-thick walls (chair legs, baseboards) at the 2 cm grid resolution. The neighbour-count test preserves any pixel on a connected wall (≥ 1 neighbour) while still removing isolated salt-and-pepper noise. Soille 2003 (above) covers the morphological foundations.

## 6. Deployed-system wire format (ROS 2)

In Tankhun's architecture the planner is a ROS 2 node `path_planner_node`
on the laptop, not a Flask app. The algorithm is the same; only the I/O
layer differs from section 3.

**Subscriptions**

| Topic | Type | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/goal_pose` | `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` | on user submit | from Flask UI on laptop |
| `/formation/footprint` | `geometry_msgs/Polygon` | on change | convex envelope around all robots + payload (from `formation_size_node`); the planner converts to a bounding-circle radius |
| `/tb3_0/pose` | `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` | 20 Hz | fused odom + RTAB pose from `ekf_node` on tb3_0 |
| `/tb3_1/pose` | `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` | 20 Hz | same, on tb3_1 |

**Publication**

| Topic | Type | QoS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/formation/path` | `geometry_msgs/PoseArray` | `transient_local` (latched), depth 1, reliable | one-shot per goal; late subscribers (e.g., a follower's dormant `path_follower_node` after a leader handover) receive the cached plan automatically |

**Virtual center input.** `path_planner_node` computes
`C = ((P0.x + P1.x)/2, (P0.y + P1.y)/2)` from the two pose subscriptions
and passes `C` as the planner's `start`. `start_yaw` is the average of the
two robot yaws (atan2 of summed sin/cos to handle the ±π wrap).

**Goal yaw** is read from `goal_pose.pose.orientation.z` (yaw quaternion
component) and passed to `compute_plan` as `goal_yaw`.

**Per-waypoint orientation in the published `PoseArray`** is set by
`compute_plan`'s `headings` list (which honours `yaw_policy`):
`pose.orientation = yaw_to_quat(heading[i])` for each waypoint.

**Wrapper file:**
`ros2_ws/src/swerve_formation/swerve_formation/path_planner_node.py`
imports `astar_planner.compute_plan()` from `interface/` verbatim.
